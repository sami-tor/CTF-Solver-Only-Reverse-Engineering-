# CTF-Solver-Only-Reverse-Engineering-
CTF Advanced Analyzer is a Python-based tool for reverse engineering and CTF forensics. It detects PE/ELF formats, extracts ASCII/UTF-16 strings, finds flags via layered decoding (Base64/58/85, ROT, XOR, Vigen√®re), and reports APIs, DLLs, packers, entropy, and network usage. Generates detailed text reports.
